# ios-testbed
A simple and small embedded browser implementation for rapid iOS testing.

We use this to test various iOS simulators via an embed, either WKWebView or UIWebView.  To test, open TestIOS.xcodeproj in XCode, then open ViewController.m.  Edit the variables in the ViewDidLoad method and run.
